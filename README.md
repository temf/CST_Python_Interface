# CST_Python_Interface

This repository provides a documentation and a few example templates for using the python interface of CST. 

In order to use the interface, CST 2020 (or newer) and Python 3.6.xx is required. For more details we refer to the documentation.

In order to run the templates, two CST files are required. Both can be found in the Component Library of CST 2020:
- S-Parameter Lowpass (as a CST Design Studio example)
- Lossy Loaded Waveguide (as a CST Microwave Studio example)
